1.  **Automated Processing:** Records are automatically processed when emailed to CipherBPA & CipherBPA+ AI.
2.  **Secure Encryption:** Documents are securely encrypted.
3.  **NFTitle Network Integration:** Encrypted records are integrated into the [NFTitle Network](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://nptitle.network) and minted as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
4.  **Decentralized and Cloud Storage:** Data is stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
5.  **Blockchain Recording:** A cryptographic hash of the data is recorded on a blockchain using the **UBQT\_B Enterprise Utility Token** on BNB Chain.

**Seamless Workflow:**
CipherBPA+ AI offers direct integrations with leading closing room software, including Snapdocs, Doma, Qualia, SoftPro, ResWare, and BoltTrail, ensuring a smooth and automated workflow for all your transactions.
